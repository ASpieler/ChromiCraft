			As you have already learned, light blue energy is associated most with time and its manipulation. By concentrating this energy and binding it in a crystal structure - a vast improvement over the previous design you scribbled out after slipping and knocking yourself unconscious on a cauldron - you might be able to set up a localized field in which time progresses at a greatly increased rate.

			Comes in various tiers, each tier being twice as powerful as the last
			Localized effects may be ineffective over things whose essence is less concentrated

			Too often you come home to find your constructions damaged or outright destroyed - or just half of your valuables missing - because someone snooping around your property helped themselves to your stocks or got too close to dangerous machinery. Sometimes you are fortunate enough to have those in a position of power apply magical protection spells over your territory, but they are often of fairly limited range, and the less scrupulous enforcers will demand a steep payment from you. Finally, however, you can protect yourself by applying a smaller version of that yourself; each stone emits an aura that prevents those you do not trust from helping themselves to your resources or your structures.

			Protects against block placement and breaking, and the opening of GUIs within a %d block range
			Owners and admins always have permissions; the owner can also use /guardstone add/remove &#60;player&#62; to allow/deny others access
