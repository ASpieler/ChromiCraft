			As you have already learned, light blue energy is associated most with time and its manipulation. By concentrating this energy and binding it in a crystal structure - a vast improvement over the previous design you scribbled out after slipping and knocking yourself unconscious on a cauldron - you might be able to set up a localized field in which time progresses at a greatly increased rate.

			Comes in various tiers, each tier being twice as powerful as the last
			Localized effects may be ineffective over things whose essence is less concentrated

			Too often you come home to find your constructions damaged or half of your valuables missing because someone snooping around your property helped themselves to your supplies. Sometimes you are fortunate and have those in power apply magical protection spells over your territory, but they are often of fairly limited range, and the less scrupulous will demand a steep payment from you to do so. Finally, however, you can protect yourself by applying a version of that yourself; each stone emits an aura that prevents those you do not trust from helping themselves to your resources or your structures.
