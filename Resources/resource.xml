	<shards>
		Crystals cannot be easily harvested; when they are broken, they drop shards, which only have traces of the magic contained in the original crystal. Nonetheless, they are your primary substrate for other materials.
	</shards>
	<dusts>
		As you have become better acquainted with the nature of the crystal elements, you have become able to notice plants scattered around the landscape. No doubt they hold some of the secrets you need.
	</dusts>
	<groups>
		Rarely are individual elements used in final construction procedures; more often, several or even all colors need to work in harmony. To accomplish this, you will find yourself joining, fusing, and otherwise restructuring the shards.
	</groups>
	<ores>
		With your increased knowledge and understanding, patches of rock that you once mistook for smooth stone now reveal themselves to you. Harvesting these is of obvious importance.
	</ores>
	<crystalstone>
		All the magic structures you have found thus far have been built of a smooth, dark stone, so it must be able to channel and conduct crystal energy. To that end, all of your constructions will probably use this material.
	</crystalstone>
	<seed>
		Searching for and harvesting crystals is often a tedious task; however, you have found a way to imbue the magic off of the shards onto a plant, turning it into a brillant crystal flower that can help supplement your shard requirements.

	<fragment>
		Scattered around the world, and occasionally dropped by those investigating the pylons too closely, are scraps of information on the fundamental elements of the universe or its applications. You will likely find those useful later. They can be added to your lexion by shift-right-clicking with the book in hand.
	</fragment>
	<berries>
		When harvesting the colored trees from around the world, you noticed that in addition to saplings and apples, they drop berries of the same color. They are too foul-tasting to be of much use for sustenance, but you can feel the tingle of energy contained within, making them a viable way to augment your own energy stores. They may also play a key role in enriching the power of crystal shards, though you will need some magical solvent.
	</berries>
	<cores>
		Some constructs need to perform special functions, like transforming their surroundings or opening a hole to the void. In order to do this, they will need to contain an appropriate core.
	</cores>
	<irid>
		You have already figured out that you can purify and then infuse shards with the essence of chroma. Now you can assemble them into larger parts which will ultimately be used to make the Power Crystals.
