		<title>
			Tangible Energy
		</title>
		<hint>
			Crystal energy is mostly an ethereal, intagible force. However, when concentrated, it may have a physical manifestation.
			</hint>
		<reveal>
			Sure enough, you have found places where crystal energy has coalesced and formed regular, glassy formations, ones that radiate the effects of their element.
		</reveal>
	</crystals>
	<casting>
		<title>
			Fabrication
		</title>
		<hint>
			Surely the wooden crafting table is not sufficient to do all your crafting.
		</hint>
		<reveal>
			As expected, to perform feats more complex than making a wooden box to store your items, you needed to create a special more magically-sound table.
		</reveal>
	</casting>
	<dyetree>
		<title>
			Technicolor Trees
		</title>
		<hint>
			These trees seem to come in all sorts of colors; you wonder if there is something special about them.
		</hint>
		<reveal>
			Well, they seem to drop berries and dyes of their color, so that has to count for something...
		</reveal>
	</dyetree>
	<multiblock>
		<title>
			More Complex Crafting
		</title>
		<hint>
			The more complex ideas you have could not possibly be pulled off with only nine constituent items...
		</hint>
		<reveal>
			Sure enough, the 5x5 afforded by the item stands is what you need.
		</reveal>
	</multiblock>
	<runeuse>
		<title>
			Weak Magical Foci
		</title>
		<hint>
			You may not be able to harness the power of the pylons yet, but these may make a milder alternative.
		</hint>
		<reveal>
			That they do, allowing you to make items more infused with energy than simple stone.
		</reveal>
	</runeuse>
	<pylon>
		<title>
			Energy Beacons
		</title>
		<hint>
			Glowing and radiant, what are these?
		</hint>
		<reveal>
			Some sort of an energy beacon...probably a good idea to remember that.
		</reveal>
	</pylon>
	<link>
		<title>
			Top-tier Crafting
		</title>
		<hint>
			Finally you can harness the pylons, but how to put it to use?
		</hint>
		<reveal>
			Channeling all that energy directly into the table has allowed you to construct devices from your wildest imagination.
		</reveal>
	</link>
	<charge>
		<title>
			Energy Internalization
		</title>
		<hint>
			If the pylons and trees can store energy, maybe you can too...
		</hint>
		<reveal>
			Turns out you can, though the acquisition process is more dangerous than is enjoyable.
		</reveal>
	</charge>
	<ability>
		<title>
			Personal Enhancement
		</title>
		<hint>
			Machines you can accelerate. Tools you can enchant. Yourself?
		</hint>
		<reveal>
			A new set of rituals has given you abilities of great utility.
		</reveal>
	</ability>
	<rainbowleaf>
		<title>
			Magical Trees
		</title>
		<hint>
			Trees in various colors were one thing. But this?
		</hint>
		<reveal>
			The raw magic energy in this tree is palpable, not to mention behind the impressive visual display.
		</reveal>
	</rainbowleaf>
	<chroma>
		<title>
			Magic Liquid
		</title>
		<hint>
			The liquid is pulsing and throbbing with raw magical energy. You wonder what its effects are...
		</hint>
		<reveal>
			Stepping in it yourself seemed to do little - though you do feel a bit rejuvenated - but its power to enrich materials is not insignificant.
		</reveal>
	</chroma>
	<stones>
		<title>
			Unity of the Elements
		</title>
		<hint>
			
		</hint>
		<reveal>

	</stones>
	<shock>
		<title>
			Damaging Discharge
		</title>
		<hint>
			Pylons seem friendly...are they?
		</hint>
		<reveal>
			If your idea of "friendly" is a discharge to the face...
		</reveal>
	</shock>
	<nether>
		<title>
			The Evil Realm
		</title>
		<hint>
			You need some other way below that unyielding rock...
		</hint>
		<reveal>
			So those stories of obsidian portals leading to a fiery nightmare are true...
		</reveal>
	</nether>
	<end>
		<title>
			The Alien Realm
		</title>
		<hint>
			Surely nothing could be more alien than that land of lava, glowing stalactites, and flying jellyfish...
		</hint>
		<reveal>
			Apparently it can.
		</reveal>
	</end>
	<twilight>
		<title>
			The Forested Realm
		</title>
		<hint>
			Legends tell of a different plane, covered in thick forests, with giant towers and buried mazes.
		</hint>
		<reveal>
			Not only does this realm exist, but it teems with unique creatures and is plentiful with treasure.
		</reveal>
	</twilight>
	<bedrock>
		<title>
			World Floor
		</title>
		<hint>
			Is it possible to dig too deep?
		</hint>
		<reveal>
			Maybe, but that layer of rock below seems impenetrable.
		</reveal>
	</bedrock>
	<cavern>
		<title>
			Buried Hollows
		</title>
		<hint>
			
		</hint>
		<reveal>

	<burrow>
		<title>
			Secret Burrows
		</title>
		<hint>
			
		</hint>
		<reveal>

		</reveal>
	</burrow>
	<ocean>
		<title>
			Ocean Temples
		</title>
		<hint>
			Stories abound of strange structures left in the deepest parts of the ocean.
		</hint>
		<reveal>
			True stories, it seems. If only they warned of the danger...
		</reveal>
	</ocean>
	<die>
		<title>
			Painful Loss
		</title>
		<hint>
			You lose your items when you die; what happens to your knowledge?
		</hint>
		<reveal>
			Lost too. Ouch.
		</reveal>
	</die>
	<allcolors>
		<title>
			Elemental Awareness
		</title>
		<hint>
			Red, Green, Blue, Orange, how many are there?
		</hint>
		<reveal>
			You have identified sixteen, each with a unique color and symbolic icon.
		</reveal>
	</allcolors>
	<repeater>
		<title>
			Broadcasting
		</title>
		<hint>
			Unless you set up dangerously close to a pylon, there does not seem to be a way to use them, as their range is too limited.
		</hint>
		<reveal>
			These refractors of a sort seem to be able to reconcentrate and repeat the signal.
